## 🧠 About Me

👋 Hey! I’m Ali Yaqubi (dayigorbay), a 16-year-old student in the Network & Software field and a software developer from Neyshabur, Iran 🇮🇷.

🚀 I’m deeply passionate about building scalable, high-performance software and applications, exploring modern architectures in computer engineering, and constantly learning new and emerging technologies.

🤖 During my childhood, I was actively involved in electronics and robotics, but over time—through deep immersion in the world of gaming 🎮—I was drawn toward programming and computer engineering, which has now become an essential part of my daily life.

💻 I started programming by designing multiplayer gaming environments (such as MTA:SA), and later moved toward web application development and software engineering.

🎯 Currently, my main goals are continuing my education and immigrating, while pursuing computer engineering and simultaneously managing and working on programming projects.
